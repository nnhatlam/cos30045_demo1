GenAI is used properly in exercise 0.2 to develop the html, css code of the website. In this assignment, I use Github copilot with the following prompts:
-	style the h1, h2, h3, text, box in the same style and colour as the other components, add information to the televisions page and home page. add hover button effect, showing some kind of televisions, for the images, add some kind of placeholder and i will insert the images myself
-	highlight the home, televisions or about button if user is in that page
